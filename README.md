# XHack Virtual Machine Translator

A homework assignment for a course in Compiler Design, this translator is the main part of a toolchain that compiles .jack code into .hack code. This project was based on the Nand2Tetris series of projects (https://www.nand2tetris.org/course), but has additional features such as error checking and support for 'constant' and 'ram' memory segments.
